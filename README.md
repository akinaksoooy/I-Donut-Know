# Goal of the game: 
Calm down and distract yourself by playing this game in any uncomfortable situation.

# About the game:
- The most important reason for me to choose this game is that, according to research, I read that playing puzzles relaxes and calms children.
- In this game, we place the rings of different colors on the stands so that all the sticks are the same color.
- In the future, I will turn the rings into cute donuts of different colors to make this game more appealing to children.
- The sound added to the game is "Aloha Ae", a very relaxing soundtrack from the Sponge Bob Square Pants, the favorite cartoon of both me and thousands of children. In addition, children will remember the calming mood when they watched the cartoon and will relax more.

Note: 
This game is quite possible to be converted into a VR Project in the future.
